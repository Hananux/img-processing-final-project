# Img Processing final project
## About the Project

This is my final project for the Image Processing course. The project includes 6 problems that cover different image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV. I used only the images that were shared with us in the project folder.

Everything was done in a Jupyter Notebook, and I tried to explain each step using markdown and comments in the code. All results are shown with images.

# Used Libraries
-  cv2 (OpenCV): for image processing functions
    
-  numpy: for numerical operations and array handling
    
-   matplotlib.pyplot: for displaying images and plots
    
-   random: for selecting random pixels
